# BufferMind Agents 🚀
**Samsung AX InnovateX Hackathon 2026**

**Problem Statement 03**  
Context-Aware, Adaptive Memory Solution for Mobile Agentic Systems

---

# 🎯 Project Idea

BufferMind is an AI-powered predictive audio buffering system for Android.

The system detects:
- walking/movement
- weak connectivity
- listening habits
- repeated music loops

and intelligently preloads audio before signal drops happen.

Goal:
Provide seamless music and podcast playback during outdoor movement and poor network conditions.

---

# 🧠 Core Solution

Unlike Spotify or YouTube Music which buffer reactively, BufferMind predicts future listening context and proactively allocates memory/cache.

### Real Flow
Sensors detect walking + playback behavior  
→ AI predicts possible disconnect  
→ Adaptive cache manager preloads audio  
→ ExoPlayer buffers stream ahead  
→ Signal drops  
→ Playback continues seamlessly

---

# 🏗️ Planned Technical Architecture

Sensors → Context Predictor → Adaptive Cache Manager → ExoPlayer Buffer → Seamless Playback

### Tech Stack
- Android
- Kotlin
- ExoPlayer Media3
- SensorManager APIs
- TensorFlow Lite (planned)
- RL-based cache management (planned)
- RoomDB (planned)
